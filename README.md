Hiya! I'm Pauline and I am a [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) grad (Sept '22 intake)

Creating and developing software was never something that I thought would be in my wheel house. However, with lots of hard work I'm inspired to create software that is functional and helps people daily. I am in awe of the posibilities of software engineering to change the everyday and make the impossible possible, This is one of the reasons that I push myself to learn more programming everyday.

I enjoy developing and this is the main reason I am pursuing this career path because I am a committed life long learner. This challenge of self study, courses and attending conferences and tech events and meetups is exciting to me

## Experience

**Women's Equality Party** ( Feb 2019 to Feb 2021)  
_Members & Supporters Officer_
- The db was incomplete containing bad fields, so I came up with
a plan which included updating and reaching out to members on multi platforms for updates. This was invaluable to the backbone of the party. - Grew members by 2.5 to 5k in 9 months by adjusting mailshots/comms. - A survey showed members were overwhelmed by the volume
of comms, so I streamlined and re-focussed messaging ensuring more relevant content delivered at more effective times. Executed over multiple platforms, tracking showed increased engagement by 72%.
- A freelance developer teamâ€™s continual ad-hoc changes to the website spiralled monthly costs so I identified and applied source-code fixes
to update election info and minimise developer fees.
- During a fundraising evening a record amount for the party was pledged, but due to data privacy issues actual funds had not been actioned. I used the db analytics to target pledges and roll out payment requests which resulted in payments of 10k by close of day.

**Aquent** (2010 to 2019)  
_Freelance Account Manager_
- For brands: Apple, McDonald's, Nintendo Wii, Blackberry, Virgin
- Built relationships with key international partners resulting in clients requesting I manage their accounts solely.
- Partner with data teams to develop social media campaigns
to increase user time by 4 minutes on websites.
- Created and managed content across multiple platforms solving PR and radio broadcast challenges with engineering and data solutions.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (start_date to end_date)
- Use short descriptions of what you did and a skill you used. (Similar to format from the 'Work Experience' section above)
- e.g Frequently used paring in order to problemsolve effeciently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- you might also mention aspects some other skills/knowledge listed below:
