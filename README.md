Hiya! I'm Pauline and I am a [Makers Academy!](https://makers.tech/)grad(Sept '22 intake)

Creating and developing software was never something that I thought would be in my wheel house. However, with lots of hard work I'm inspired to create software that is functional and helps people daily. I am in awe of the posibilities of software engineering to change the everyday and make the impossible possible, This is one of the reasons that I push myself to learn more programming everyday.

I enjoy developing and this is the main reason I am pursuing this career path because I am a committed life long learner. This challenge of self study, courses and attending conferences and tech events and meetups is exciting to me
