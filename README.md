Hiya! I'm Pauline and I am a [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) grad (Sept '22 intake)

Creating and developing software was never something that I thought would be in my wheel house. However, with lots of hard work I'm inspired to create software that is functional and helps people daily. I am in awe of the posibilities of software engineering to change the everyday and make the impossible possible, This is one of the reasons that I push myself to learn more programming everyday.

I enjoy developing and this is the main reason I am pursuing this career path because I am a committed life long learner. This challenge of self study, courses and attending conferences and tech events and meetups is exciting to me and now my new normal.

#### Communication

Effective communication was essential to my account managing career.  In any fast-paced and constantly evolving environment, it is important to be able to clearly and effectively communicate with clients, project managers and team members. My ability to listen and understand the needs and goals of a project, as well as being able to articulate technical solutions aand ideas to ensure deadlines and schedules are met. As a developer, being clear and concise, practice acting listening, feedback to the team  and using visual aids like my diagrams & design recipes and finding a way to communicate my progress as  integral to the success of the team.

#### Initiatives

During lockdown and the end of a freelance opportunity I was able to pivot and brush up my online learning. Studying peer mentoring, conversational French, introduction to ESOL teaching & nutrition. I learnt to rehone my study skills and start my software development career. I also enjoy attending meetup and networking events weekly to build my software network.  This resourcefullness also includes running and selling a cosmetic business at a profit in Notting Hill in 2015.

#### Attention to detail

I enjoying paying attention to detail from design elements, like layout, colour scheme and font choices I am detail orientates, and during pairing sessions have helped to spot coding errors quickly and enjoy collaborating to follow coding conventions and standards. Maing your code easier to read and understand for all.

#### Maintaing calm & empathy

Whether dealing with celebritities or brand ambassadors, I communicate confidently and am able to put myself in others circumstance  I am to read the situation and actively listen. In conversation or group discussion, I l definitely practice mindfulness and stay present in the moment and stay calm.

## Experience

**Women's Equality Party** ( Feb 2019 to Feb 2021)  
_Members & Supporters Officer_
- The db was incomplete containing bad fields, so I came up with
a plan which included updating and reaching out to members on multi platforms for updates. This was invaluable to the backbone of the party. - Grew members by 2.5 to 5k in 9 months by adjusting mailshots/comms. - A survey showed members were overwhelmed by the volume
of comms, so I streamlined and re-focussed messaging ensuring more relevant content delivered at more effective times. Executed over multiple platforms, tracking showed increased engagement by 72%.
- A freelance developer team’s continual ad-hoc changes to the website spiralled monthly costs so I identified and applied source-code fixes
to update election info and minimise developer fees.
- During a fundraising evening a record amount for the party was pledged, but due to data privacy issues actual funds had not been actioned. I used the db analytics to target pledges and roll out payment requests which resulted in payments of 10k by close of day.

**Aquent** (2010 to 2019)  
_Freelance Account Manager_
- For brands: Apple, McDonald's, Nintendo Wii, Blackberry, Virgin
- Built relationships with key international partners resulting in clients requesting I manage their accounts solely.
- Partner with data teams to develop social media campaigns
to increase user time by 4 minutes on websites.
- Created and managed content across multiple platforms solving PR and radio broadcast challenges with engineering and data solutions.
